			If owning a car is so great, why does it come with so many headaches? It just sits there for most of the time anyway. Depending on where you live, you have to deal with parking, traffic, insurance, maintenance, and everything else. Whether you want to be driven to work every morning to catch some extra sleep, or get an early start. Or may you had too much fun at the club and you need a ride home. Until now.

			What if you had 24/7 access to your own personal driver? You could be driven to work to catch some more z's, or get an early start on emails. You could have too much of a great time downtown, and know you have a ride home. You can get to the business place, and never have to worry about parking
